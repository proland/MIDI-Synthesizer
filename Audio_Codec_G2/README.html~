DESCRIPTION:<br><br>

This is my audio codec controller for the DE2 Board. I found the original code on the altera forums, and the i2c controller was found in the demonstrations folder of the /opt/altera subdirectory. I took the i2c controller and translated it from verilog to vhdl. I wrote some glue code and removed some of the useless parts of the code, and i also wrote a frequency generator as an example.<br><br>

This code is quite simple to use, and all you have to add to it is your main system ports and components, and instantiate your main system from the top level design file (DE1_Audio_AdcDac.vhd). From there, the i2c controller will set up the audio codec for output use, and i wrote some code that will output sine/square/sawtooth/triangle waves as a demonstrations.<br><br>

CONTROLS:<br><br>

Main Power: SW(0)<br>
Volume: SW(17) (to select up/down) + Key(3)<br>
Change Note: SW(16) (to select up/down) + Key(2)<br>
Change Wave: Key(3) will cycle through all 4<br><br>

KNOWN ISSUES:<br><br>

The ACKs in the i2c controller do not work, so i just turned them off. This doesnt seem to cause any issues though, as the sampling rate is still ~47KHz when measured on the oscilliscope (using GPIO_1[9]).<br><br>

My frequency generator code does not play note 1-78 correctly. All of the high notes change their sound accordingly, but the lower note stay at a constant frequency, and just decrease in volume. I'm really not sure what is going on here, so let me know if you figure it out.<br><br>
