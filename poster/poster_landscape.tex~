    The goal of this project was to develop a digital audio synthesizer using the MIDI communication protocol. The product functions similarly to a commercially available synthesizer product, albiet with a slightly reduced feature set.

    Sound synthesis in this project is accomplished through Wavetable Lookup Synthesis. This process involves storing a sample waveform in a lookup table, then playing those samples at a varying rate dependant upon what frequency you desire to output.
