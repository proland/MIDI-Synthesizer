%%% Each box has a name and can be placed absolutely or relatively.
%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position 
%%% towards an already declared box. So if you have a box attached to the 
%%% bottom, one to the top and a third one which should be inbetween, you 
%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The goal of this project was to develop a digital audio synthesizer using the MIDI communication protocol. The product functions similarly to a commercially available synthesizer product, albiet with a slightly reduced feature set.

    Sound synthesis in this project is accomplished through Wavetable Lookup Synthesis. This process involves storing a sample waveform in a lookup table, then playing those samples at a varying rate dependant upon what frequency you desire to output.
